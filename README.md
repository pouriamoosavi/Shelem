<h3>Attention! not complete yet</h3>
Shelem is an Iranian card game which starts with 4 players. <br>
This project is an open-source online Shelem application, It is based on express.js and socket.io. For database I have used lowdb. Also the 'index.html' file wno't be developed any more and we have added a new project as 'shelem-frontend' which is written in react.js and supposed to be this project's frontend.<br>
To run(unix): 
<pre>cd [project_directory]
npm i 
node app.js</pre><br>
